  # Perhaps aptly titled by their name, ports are an essential point in which data can be exchanged. 
  # Think of a harbour and port. 
  # Ships wishing to dock at the harbour will have to go to a port compatible with the dimensions and the facilities located on the ship.
  # When the ship lines up, it will connect to a port at the harbour. 
  # Take, for instance, that a cruise liner cannot dock at a port made for a fishing vessel and vice versa.
  # These ports enforce what can park and where â€” if it isn't compatible, it cannot park here.
  # Networking devices also use ports to enforce strict rules when communicating with one another.
  # When a connection has been established, any data sent or received by a device will be sent through these ports. 
  # In computing, ports are a numerical value between 0 and 65535 (65,535).
  # Because ports can range from anywhere between 0-65535, there quickly runs the risk of losing track of what aplication is using what port. 
  # A busy harbour is chaos! Thankfully, we associate applications, software and behaviours with a standard set of rules. 
  # For example, by enforcing that any web browser data is sent over port 80, software developers can design a web browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox to interpret the data the same way as one another.
  # This means that all web browsers now share one common rule: data is sent over port 80.   
  # How the browsers look, feel and easy to use is up to the designer or the user's decision.
  # While the standard rule for web data is port 80, a few other protocols have been allocated a standard rule. 
  # Any port that is within 0 and 1024 (1,024) is known as a common port.
